FATE Core RPG Character Sheet
=========================
Origin of concept
----
For the past few years, I've played tabletop RPGs with a few friends from high school and inevitably, one of us ends up losing their character sheet or recreating it every few sessions after countless changes have made it an unreadable mess.

My goal with this project was to recreate the [Character Sheet from the Fate RPG Core System](https://www.evilhat.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Fate-Core-Character-Sheet.pdf)
